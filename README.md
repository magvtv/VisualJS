# Visuals JS 
Basics on HTML Canvas and creative sketches of my own. Also might name this 'Creative Coding.' 
That suits it rather than Visuals JS. Actually, that is a cool name if i ever think of making a library out of it. Learning this from a domestika course by Bruno Imbrizi. This is the part one of the course, heard that there was a part two. 
It has just become something I got inspired in on April '22 and told myself that i would venture into it. Still intrigued, will be sure to frop a few snapshots of what I am talking about.
